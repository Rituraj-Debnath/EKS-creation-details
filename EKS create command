######### EKS Creation using eksctl command with the lowest cost possible ###########

eksctl create cluster \
  --name cheap-cluster \
  --region ap-south-1 \
  --node-type t3.small \
  --nodes 1 \
  --nodes-min 1 \
  --nodes-max 1 \
  --nodegroup-name workers \
  #--auto-mode-config-enabled=false


Here a cluster will be created with the name,,,all the things here are changeable after cluster creation ,,but not the k8s cluster name.  in future in the new eksctl version auto
mode will be enabled by defualt means it will be costly as it would add many add ons in the cluster ,,so from now we are turning off the auto mode, but cant use that flag as auto 
mode is not still supprted ,, maybe later versions would support the flag!
